# Paintball-Project-Python
A python project that deals with paintball triggers done using the graph and dictionary data structures.When a paintball is triggered,
if any of the cows are in the radius of the paintball blast,they would be colored by all those colors whose blast radius is inclusive
of the position of the cows.Also,if another paintball lies in the range of one paintball blast,it is triggered as well
and this continues.So,displaying the cows and all the colors they are colored with is the aim.
